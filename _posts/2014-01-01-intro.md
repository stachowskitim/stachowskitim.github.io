# Tim Stachowski

I'm currently a postdoc in the **Fischer Lab** at **St. Jude Children's Research Hospital** <br>
in **Memphis, TN**. My work focuses on investigating the role waters play in influencing protein conformations and protein-ligand interactions, particularly as a consquence of environmental factors. I did my graduate work with **Edward Snell, PhD** at the **Hauptman Woodward Institute** <br>
and the **University at Buffalo** developing methods to investigate the effects of ionizing radiation on protein strucutral dynamics. I'm interested in the intersection of experimental and computational approaches when applied to understanding how protein dynamics underscores function, especially in the context of uncovering new routes for treating disease.
