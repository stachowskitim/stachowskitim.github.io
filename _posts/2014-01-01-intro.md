# Tim Stachowski

I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow in the **@TheFischerLab** at **St. Jude Children's Research Hospital**
in **Memphis, TN**. My work focuses on investigating the role water molecules play in facilitating protein conformations and protein-ligand interactions, particularly as a consquence of environmental factors such as temperature. <br> 
<br>
I did my graduate work with **Edward Snell, PhD** at the **Hauptman Woodward Institute**, **Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center**, and the **University at Buffalo** developing methods to investigate the effects of ionizing radiation on protein structural dynamics primarily using X-ray scattering and crystallography. <br> 
<br>
In general, I'm interested in the intersection of experimental and computational approaches when applied to understanding how protein dynamics underscores function, especially in the context of uncovering new routes for treating disease.<br> 
<br>
I'm also sometimes lucky enough to catch some fish in some pretty incredible places.
