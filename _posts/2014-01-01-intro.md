# Tim Stachowski

I'm currently a PhD student with **Edward Snell, PhD** at the **Hauptman Woodward Institute** <br>
and the **University at Buffalo**. My graduate work is focused on developing methods 
to study how protein structure is effected by therapeutic levels of ionizing 
radiation and more generally, the structure/function of TGFB family proteins. 

I'm interested in the intersection of experimental and computational approaches used 
to understand protein structure and engineer proteins for treating diseases.
