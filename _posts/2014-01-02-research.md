# Low-dose X-ray investigation on radiation induced TGFB-1 dynamics and sensitivity

Fig. 6: Modelling of SAXS to an ensemble of conformations reveals that LAP exists predominantly in an extended conformation. (a) A Kratky plot comparing experimental SAXS profiles for LTGFB-1 and LAP shows that LAP is more flexible. (b) The maximum particle dimension (Dmax) of the EOM random pool (blue) and of the ensemble that best explains the LAP scattering data (gold). (c) The radius of gyration (Rg) of the EOM random pool (blue) and of the ensemble (gold). (d) The LAP domain from the LTGF-1 crystal structure (blue; latency helix, purple; glycosylation, various) superimposed with
models from the selected ensemble (gold, light blue, green, light purple).

Dissociation of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB-1) from the inhibitory protein latency-associated peptide (LAP) can occur from low doses of X-ray irradiation of the LAPâ€“TGFB-1 complex, resulting in the activation of TGFB-1, and can have health-related consequences. 
Using the tools and knowledge developed in the study of radiation damage in the crystallographic setting, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and complementary techniques suggest an activation process that is initiated but not driven by the initial X-ray exposure. 
LAP is revealed to be extended when not bound to TGFB-1 and has a different structural conformation to the bound state. These studies pave the way for the structural understanding of systems impacted at therapeutic X-ray doses and show the potential impact of radiation-damage studies beyond their original intent.
