# A protein engineering approach extends X-ray scattering to watch bond breakage from radiation exposure 

<img src="img/research3.jpeg" width="60%">

Fig 3. X-ray solution scattering analysis indicating that fragmentation is radiation dose dependent. The color gradient corresponds to the magnitude of the absorbed dose (36.3 Gy-1.2 kGy) delivered across 33 x 0.3 sec exposures where yellow is low dose and black is high dose. EndoHCYS was irradiated at pH 7.5 and the results shown are averages of two replicates at a concentration of 5.0 mg/ml. In (a) buffer subtracted scattering curves exhibit a dose-dependent decrease in intensity. In (b) residuals calculated between the first exposure and each sequential exposure show that intensity decreases at low-q and increases at high-q with increasing absorbed dose. The arrow identifies an isoscattering point at q ~ 0.07 Å-1, characteristic of a transition between two states.  In (c) a pairwise distance distribution plot, P(r), normalized to MW, of the first, last exposure, and difference between first and last exposure shows that the fraction of longer distances in the protein decreased. The slope of the Guinier region remains linear (d) but decreases, indicating that the size of the protein is decreasing. A Dimensionless Kratky plot (e) also indicates that the protein is changing shape during irradiation.

A significant problem in biological X-ray crystallography is the radiation chemistry caused by the incident X-ray beam. This produces both global and site-specific damage. Site specific damage can misdirect the biological interpretation of the structural models produced. Cryo-cooling crystals has been successful in mitigating damage but not eliminating it altogether; however, cryo-cooling can be difficult in some cases and has also been shown to limit functionally relevant protein conformations. The doses used for X-ray crystallography are typically in the kilo-gray to mega-gray range. While disulfide bonds are among the most significantly affected species in proteins in the crystalline state at both cryogenic and higher temperatures, there is limited information on their response to low X-ray doses in solution, the details of which might inform biomedical applications of X-rays. In this work we engineered a protein that dimerizes through a susceptible disulfide bond to relate the radiation damage processes seen in cryo-cooled crystals to those closer to physiologic conditions. This approach enables a low-resolution technique, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), to detect and monitor a residue specific process. A dose dependent fragmentation of the engineered protein was seen that can be explained by a dimer to monomer transition through disulfide bond cleavage. This supports the crystallographically derived mechanism and demonstrates that results obtained crystallographically can be usefully extrapolated to physiologic conditions. Fragmentation was influenced by pH and the conformation of the dimer, providing information on mechanism and pointing to future routes for investigation and potential mitigation. The novel engineered protein approach to generate a large-scale change through a site-specific interaction represents a promising tool for advancing radiation damage studies under solution conditions.

# Low and high resolution modeling teamup to reveal conformational switching in latency-associpated peptide during TGF-beta1 binding

<img src="img/research2.jpeg" width="60%">

Fig5: SAXS-based rigid-body modelling and clustering shows that most apo LAP models include a reorientation of the inter-monomer position compared with the TGFβ-1 bound LAP crystal structure. (a) CORAL models from cluster 1 (gradient from yellow to red illustrating the magnitude of inter-monomer rotation relative to the bound LAP structure) and the apo LAP structure (blue) superimposed onto a single chain of bound LAP (grey/black). For clarity, models are shown without the straight-jacket domain [entire models are shown in Supplementary Fig. S3(b)]. (b) CORAL models from cluster 2 (red and gold) and the apo LAP structure (blue) superimposed onto a single chain of bound LAP (grey/black), indicating rotation (left) and displacement (right) relative to the bound LAP structure. (c) Comparison of the average theoretical scattering of models within each cluster with the experimental scattering data (top) with residuals (bottom).

In response to environmental changes, proteins are released from cells that act as messengers, which allows cells to communicate with one another and coordinate a physiologic response. Transforming growth factor β-1 (TGFβ-1) is a protein used to communicate information about when and how cells should proliferate and is particularly important in organizing embryonic tissue development. The fundamental way our cells regulate TGFβ-1 activity is with a second protein, latency-associated peptide (LAP). LAP forms a complex with TGFβ-1, tethering it to the outside surface of the cell. Several pathologies including cancer progression and immune suppression are driven by an overabundance of TGFβ-1.
Because LAP binding reduces TGFβ-1 activity, recombinant LAP is a promising novel therapeutic approach, however a detailed understanding of how LAP binds TGFβ-1 is missing, which could reveal ways to improve the LAP-TGFβ-1 interaction or develop other anti-TGFβ-1 therapies. In a paper in IUCrJ, Stachowski et al. show that LAP adopts structurally distinct conformations between unbound and TGFβ-1 bound states. This was revealed by comparing the X-ray crystal structure of LAP in the unbound state (6p7j) solved by Stachowski et al. with the crystal structure of LAP bound to TGFβ-1 (3rjr) previously reported by Shi et al. 2011 [2]. This analysis combined with solution modelling showed that LAP transitions from an extended to compact conformation when binding TGFβ-1, simulating a type of hugging motion where LAP embraces TGFβ-1. Surprisingly, this conformational change includes rearranging two domains that are distant from one another and might be coordinated through the formation of an α-helix that is distant from the LAP-TGFβ-1 interaction site. Together, these results provide new spatial details about the TGFβ-1 binding mechanism, specifically how LAP reorients itself to develop the LAP-TGFβ-1 interface. This insight is important as it provides new avenues to engineer and improve LAP as a therapeutic that are focused beyond just the interaction site.

# Low-dose X-ray investigation on radiation induced TGF-beta1 dynamics

Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is caged by a latent activator peptide. This can be released by therapeutic radiation resulting in unintended side effects. This study attempts to study the structural impact of X-ray doses in the therapeutic regime (~ 0.1-2 Gy) compared to that usually required for structural biology studies (~MGy). It is the first study to make use of tools designed to understand and mitigate radiation damage, in a manner that allows visibility into the impact of therapeutic processes.
This is important as radiation therapy is a common tool in some health areas. We know a lot about what happens structurally at doses that are orders of magnitude above the therapeutic dose, but very little about structural changes that can occur within this therapeutic regime. Knowledge of this may allow the development of prophylactic approaches to minimizing radiation therapy side effects that can be detrimental to treatment and recovery.
