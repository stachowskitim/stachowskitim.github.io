# Low-dose X-ray investigation on radiation induced TGFB-1 dynamics and sensitivity

<img src="img/research1.jpeg" width="80%">

Fig. 6: Modelling of SAXS to an ensemble of conformations reveals that LAP exists predominantly in an extended conformation. (a) A Kratky plot comparing experimental SAXS profiles for LTGFB-1 and LAP shows that LAP is more flexible. (b) The maximum particle dimension (Dmax) of the EOM random pool (blue) and of the ensemble that best explains the LAP scattering data (gold). (c) The radius of gyration (Rg) of the EOM random pool (blue) and of the ensemble (gold). (d) The LAP domain from the LTGF-1 crystal structure (blue; latency helix, purple; glycosylation, various) superimposed with
models from the selected ensemble (gold, light blue, green, light purple).

Transforming growth factor beta-1 is caged by a latent activator peptide. This can be released by therapeutic radiation resulting in unintended side effects. This study attempts to study the structural impact of X-ray doses in the therapeutic regime (~ 0.1-2 Gy) compared to that usually required for structural biology studies (~MGy). It is the first study to make use of tools designed to understand and mitigate radiation damage, in a manner that allows visibility into the impact of therapeutic processes.
This is important as radiation therapy is a common tool in some health areas. We know a lot about what happens structurally at doses that are orders of magnitude above the therapeutic dose, but very little about structural changes that can occur within this therapeutic regime. Knowledge of this may allow the development of prophylactic approaches to minimizing radiation therapy side effects that can be detrimental to treatment and recovery.
